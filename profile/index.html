 <h2>Projects:</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
Graph spanners: A spanner is a subgraph that preserves the shortest path distances approximately. Real-life networks contain millions of nodes, billions of edges, and an algorithm will be computationally expensive if the network is dense. In that case, we can compute a spanner to generate a sparse graph but with similar properties. Note that, Steiner tree is a special case of spanners. We formulated a multi-level version of spanners and a weighted version of additive spanners. We developed efficient algorithms for different types of spanners.
  </li>
  <li>
Network visualization using maps: Maps are used in day to day life for visualizing geographic maps e.g. Google Maps. There is a relationship between networks and maps: any planar graph can be converted to a map and vice versa. However, even if the graph is not planar a similar idea can be applied. A network can capture multi-relational data and have a significant impact on data visualization. The goal of this project is to visualize large networks using maps that incorporate semantic zooming as other traditional maps. We are using this visualization currently on research networks.
  </li>
  <li>
Solving graph problems using GNN: Neural networks are one of the most popular tools in data science. A traditional neural network is sequential and does not work well for multi-relational objects like graphs. A special kind of neural network called graph neural network (GNN) has been developed to handle such objects. GNNs have shown promising results for NP-complete problems. We are working on different models of GNNs to solve graph-related problems. Currently, we are using GNNs to compute Steiner trees.
  </li>
  <li>
Graph drawing via gradient descent: Developing an optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes stress together with several other criteria: edge crossings, minimum crossing angle, and upwardness (for directed acyclic graphs). This is a machine learning approach for network visualization. We are using different variations of gradient descent to generate layouts that optimize multiple criteria at the same time. The algorithms designed to optimize one criterion only typically do not provide good results on other metrics, whereas our approach has the flexibility to optimize multiple criteria as well as preserving the network topology.
  </li>
  <li>
Online facility assignment: We formulated an online problem where a set of facilities is situated on an object e.g. graph, plane, line. Each facility has a capacity. The customers appear in an online manner and have to be assigned to a free facility before a new customer appears. We developed different deterministic and randomized algorithms for this problem. This problem is related to game theory, the analysis of the algorithms we are developing is similar to a game between an online player and an adversary.
