      <h2>Force directed algorithms</h2>
      <p>Force-directed algorithms are among the most flexible methods for calculating layouts of simple undirected graphs. Also known as spring embedders, such algorithms calculate the layout of a graph using only information contained within the structure of the graph itself, rather than relying on domain-specific knowledge. Graphs drawn with these algorithms tend to be aesthetically pleasing, exhibit symmetries, and tend to produce crossing-free layouts for planar graphs. In this survey we consider several classical algorithms, starting from Tutteâ€™s 1963 barycentric method, and including recent scalable multiscale methods for large and dynamic graphs.</p>

      <h2>Stress optimization</h2>
      <p>Stress is defined as the difference between layout distance and network distance. Thus reducing the stress in a layout corresponds
to computing node positions so that the actual distance between pairs of nodes is proportional to the graph theoretic distance between them. Optimizing stress
can be accomplished by stress minimization, or stress majorization, which can
speed up the computation. In this course we only consider drawing in the
Euclidean plane, however, stress can be also optimized in other spaces such as
the torus.</p>
