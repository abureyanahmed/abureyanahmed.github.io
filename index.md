**Research interest: Data science, Algorithms, Visualization**

**Projects:**
- Visualizing large networks using multi-level representation using Steiner trees and graph spanners. We are designing heuristics, exact algorithms, and graph neural networks for these problems. The experiments are executed with the help of high-performance computing due to the computational hardness of exact algorithms. The objective of this project is to provide efficient heuristics for multi-level representation of large networks.
- Developing an optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes stress together with several other criteria: edge crossings, minimum crossing angle, and upwardness (for directed acyclic graphs). This is a machine learning approach for network visualization. We are using different variations of gradient descent to generate layouts that optimise multiple criteria at the same time. The algorithms designed to optimize one criteria only typically do not provide good results on other metrics, whereas our approach has the flexibility to optimize multiple criteria as well as preserving the network topology.


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/abureyanahmed/abureyanahmed.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
